I got my General ticket in May 2020, so I'm still getting started.

I come to amateur radio after years of working in the technology field.
My primary motivation for getting involved was emergency communications
after having moved down to Florida.

I am currently a member of the following clubs:

* [Orlando Amateur Radio Club (OARC)](https://oarc.org/)
* [Solvita Radio Club (SRC)](https://solivitaradioclub.weebly.com/)
* [ARRL](https://www.arrl.org/)

# Station equipment

* Yaesu FTM-400XDR
* Comet CA-2X4SR NMO
* TIDRADIO TD-H6 HT
* TIDRADIO TD-UV5RPro HT
* RTL-SDR USB
* Digirig Mobile v1.9
