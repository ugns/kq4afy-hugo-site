Like for many ham operators, [POTA] is a great way to practice our skills as radio operators.
For me this is no exception.

<!--more-->

I began working [POTA] as a hunter using remote HF stations through [RHR]. So my initial
hunting was done primarialy from grids FN51 and FN54, but also a few contacts made from FN31 and EM73. Due the airtime costs I limited myself to FT8 digital mode which made for quicker
contacts.

I have my HF rig ([FT-991A]) and have picked up hunting from my QTH,in grid EL98. I have also recently acquired a Bioenno LiFePO4 battery so I am no longer dependent on the Alinco 30A switching power supply and have begun activating parks. I operate with a couple of different vertical antennas
that are portable and quick to set up. I still operate mostly digital (FT8 and FT4) while still doing
some SSB.

Here below you can see my [POTA] stats or you can go check out my [profile](https://pota.app/#/profile/KQ4AFY) directly, or my achievement [certificates]({{< ref "gallery/awards" >}}).
