Like for many ham operators, [POTA] is a great way to practice our skills as radio operators.
For me this is no exception.

<!--more-->

I began working [POTA] as a hunter using remote HF stations through [RHR]. So my initial
hunting was done primarialy from grids FN51 and FN54, but also a few contacts made from FN31 and EM73. Due the airtime costs I limited myself to FT8 digital mode which made for quicker
contacts. 

I now have my HF rig ([FT-991A]) and have picked up hunting from my QTH, in grid EL98. I do hope
to start activating parks as soon as I acquire a LiFePO4 battery as I currently am using an
Alinco 30A switching power supply only.

Here below you can see my POTA stats or you can go check out my [POTA profile](https://pota.app/#/profile/KQ4AFY) directly.
