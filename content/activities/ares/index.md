My primary interest in acquiring my ham license was for emergency communications,
so getting involved with ARES and becoming a SKYWARN spotter seemed logical.

I am a member of [Osceola County ARES](https://www.osceolacountyares.org/) which meets
on the last Monday of the month at the Osceola Count Emergency Operations Center in
Kissimmee, FL.

I have also gone through the NOAA National Weather Service [SKYWARN] training through the
Melbourne, FL Weather Forecast Office and received my spotter ID.
