My primary interest in acquiring my ham license was for emergency communications,
so getting involved with ARES and becoming a [SKYWARN] spotter seemed logical.

I am a member of [Osceola County ARES](https://www.osceolacountyares.org/) which meets
on the last Monday of the month at the Osceola County Emergency Operations Center in
Kissimmee, FL. I have helped man the ARES booth at the county hurricane preparedness
event as well as attending monthly meetings and weekly nets.

I have begun the process of going through all recommended emergency management courses
outlined in both the [ARRL ARES][ARESPTB] and the [Florida Tri-Section ARES][FLARESPTB]
Training Plan Task Books. My progress can be seen by my [certificates of completion]({{< relref "gallery/training" >}}).

I have also gone through the NOAA National Weather Service [SKYWARN] training through the
Melbourne, FL Weather Forecast Office annually and received my spotter ID.
