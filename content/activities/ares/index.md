My primary interest in acquiring my ham license was for emergency communications,
so getting involved with ARES and becoming a NWS [SKYWARN]:registered: Spotter seemed logical.

I am serving as a board member of [Osceola ARES](https://www.osceolacountyares.org/):registered: which meets
on the last Monday of the month at the Osceola County Emergency Operations Center in
Kissimmee, FL. I have helped staff the ARES :registered: booth at the county hurricane preparedness
event as well as attending monthly meetings and weekly nets.

I am registered on [FEMA EMI][FEMA] so I can work through the
Indepedent Study (IS) courses available. I am also registered
on [FDEM] SERT TRAC so I can register and attend classes not IS.
I have begun the process of going through all recommended emergency
management courses outlined in both the [ARRL ARES][ARESPTB]:registered: and the
[Florida Tri-Section ARES][FLARESPTB]:registered: Training Plan Task Books.
My progress can be seen by my [certificates of completion]({{< relref "gallery/training" >}}).

I have also gone through the NOAA National Weather Service [SKYWARN]:registered: training offered through the Melbourne, FL Weather Forecast Office
annually and have received my spotter ID.
