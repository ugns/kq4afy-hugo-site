Great information comes from being involved with fellow hams through
the local amateur radio clubs.

<!--more-->

I enjoy being apart of the [Solivita Radio Club][SRC] in the Solivita
Retirement Community in Poinciana, FL that my mother-in-law lives.
I'm an associate member as I don't live in the community but have easy
access. I've enjoyed taking part in the club fox hunts, field days and
regular monthly meetings on the last Thursday of the month.

Prior to moving into our new home, I was within range to join the
regular daily nets on the N4SRC repeater. I still try to make the nets
now but need to work on getting a better signal to it being further
away from it. I used to be able to hit it with a 8-10W HT, but now I
have struggled with my FTM-400XDR in my vehicle parked in my drive-way.

I am also an active member with the [Orlando Amateur Radio Club][OARC]
that meets on the first Wednesday of the month up at the Beardall
Senior Center in Orlando, FL. I volunteered with OARC for Orlando
[HamCation][HAMCATION] in 2023 while attending for my first time. In
2024 I stepped up and joined the HamCation committee as an Assistant
Security Chairman.

Along with the local clubs, I am also a member of the [ARRL]. Both
[SRC] and [OARC] are ARRL Affliated clubs. I've enjoyed taking part in
[Winter Field Day][WFD] and [Summer Field Day][ARRLFD] working with SRC.

I also use the [Logbook of the World][LotW]
to log my HF contacts. I have also been participating in the [VOTA]
event going on this year.
