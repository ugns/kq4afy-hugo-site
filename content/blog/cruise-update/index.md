Getting closer to "Cruise Day" and plans are proceeding on schedule.
Itinerary changed and visitor operating permissions obtained.

<!--more-->

Since the last update on my cruise plans, [MSC Cruises][MSC] has
notified us that our port of call in Ocho Rios, Jamaica has been moved
instead to Falmouth, Jamaica due to pier damage that makes it unsafe to
dock. I guess this then makes the fact that I have failed to hear
anything back from the Jamaican [SMA] regarding my visitor operator
license application request okay as there are no [POTA] parks within
the Trelawny Parrish that Falmouth is located, unlike Saint Ann Parrish
where Ocho Rios is located that had a quaint little park not far from
the port.

As of my last update I had already obtained my operating permissions
from [OFREG] in the Cayman Islands, but now I have also received them
from the [URCA] in the Bahamas which was my other port of call I had
planned to activate. While I now hold my Amateur Extra class license
which gives me reciprocal operating privileges under [CEPT], I am still
not trying to get permission from the Ship's Master (Captain) to be able
to operate from the cruise ship while in international waters. Maybe
after I see how this trip goes I might look into that on a future
cruising, but for now I am going to just be happy doing POTA during our
port of calls.

The cruise itinerary has us departing Port Canveral, Florida on Sunday
and has us scheduled to reach Nassau, Bahamas by 10:00 EST (14:00 UTC)
on Monday with a scheduled departure at 18:00 EST (22:00 UTC). The
plan so far is to activate [BS-0025] as it is the closest park to the
cruise terminal. I had [BS-0023] as a possible alternative or an
additional park to activate while in port, but unfortunately checking
back on it I've found from [BNT] that operates the parks that it is
currently closed for habitat restoration and infrastructural repairs.
If I have time and can secure transportation I might consider [BS-0022]
as an additional park to activate time permitting. Since the parks do
have a fee to enter I decided to go ahead and become a [BNT] member
which gives free entry to all parks for the year. I consider it just as
I do the annual pass for the Florida State Parks so I can activate them.
It is supporting the parks to ensure they are here for us to enjoy!

We will be at sea on Tuesday and scheduled to reach Jamaica on
Wednesday. The scheduled arrival is 08:00 EST (12:00 UTC) when it
was Ocho Rios but don't know if that is still the same for Falmouth.
Thursday is scheduled to arrive in George Town, Cayman Islands by
08:00 EST (12:00 UTC) with scheduled departure at 16:00 EST (20:00 UTC).
I have got my sights on activating [KY-0010] that is walking distance
from the cruise port. I have been in contact with [ZF1PB] and hoping to
meet up with him and anyone else from the [CARS] that is available
while I am in port. Again depending on time and transportation I have
[KY-0003], [KY-0009] and [KY-0004] that might be on the block for
activation as well.

The rest of the cruise itinerary has us in Cozumel, Mexico on Friday
and back to Port Canaveral on Sunday after another day at sea. While
there is 17 POTA parks registered on the small Cozumel Island and many
appear to never have been activated prior, there is no reciprocal
agreements in place between the USA and Mexico. Maybe that will change
or I can look to see what is required to get a license under Mexico
for a future trip.

While the scheduled port calls are around 8 hours long, I know I will
not have the full 8 hours as it will take time to get off the ship and
make my way to the parks I intend to activate. Going out on my own I am
also very aware that I need to be onboard the ship by the "All Aboard"
time or risk being left behind and a huge expense to get to the next
port to get back on the ship so I do not want to risk that. Also not
being sure of transportation I have tried to target parks near the
cruise terminals. If I'm able to secure transportation then I will try
to activate as many parks as time permits of course. What I do not get
to activate this trip, there will always be another as Caribbean cruises
are very easy to take from Florida ports.

Honestly, everything is looking good at this point in the plans. I did
have someone from [MSC] reach out via phone the other week and I was
able to explain my plans and my concern to make sure everything was done
above board to ensure no issues at the terminal during embarkation. To
this point I have not received anything further back from [MSC], which
honestly at this point does not surprise me, so I am proceeding as
planned. I have spoken with other content creators who have taken drones
with them on cruises to use while in port on [MSC] ships with positive
results despite initial security concerns. The suggestion made to me by
one was to ensure I keep a copy of my licenses with the radio and if
questions come up to politely ask to speak with the Captain at the
terminal as they did so and their drone was released to go aboard. I had
already planned to have copies with me in my laptop back along with the
other cruise documents, so I will just print an extra copy to place in
the case with the radio.

I am so looking forward to this vacation and enjoying the opportunity
to operate my radio abroad earning new DX Activator entities.
