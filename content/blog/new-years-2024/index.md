This year I enjoyed working through radio making contacts to start
the new year. I had great results making contacts from the backyard
with my [FT-991A].


<!--more-->

As I only got my license in 2022 after passing my General exam on May
4th, and only got my HF rig during 2023, I looked forward to being able
to start the New Year off on the air. I did this in between being out
driving for Lyft over the New Years Weekend.

I worked this also towards my [QRZ] 12 Days of QRZ 2023 award as well
which included my days working over Christmas weekend and accounted for 
over half of the days needed. I setup my [FT-991A] out on the lanai with
my custom [PREDator][PREDATOR] vertical antenna I had assembled. This
was the first real time working it after aquiring all the parts I needed
to assemble it. I had been pointed towards it after a POTA activation
where I had a contact just blasting through and we got in contact via
email afterwards to discuss setups.

Over the weekend I worked 15m, 20m and 40m bands FT8 and FT4 working 128
QSOs from 37 countries over 3.5 days. My longest QSO was with VK6AS all
the way out in Australia over 20m. Overall I found the [PREDator][PREDATOR]
antenna worked wonderfully though a bit more complicated to setup than
my [GRA-7350T]. I still take both with me when I do POTA activations as
the one handles 10-20m fine while the other gives me 10-80m to work. I
find when setting up either my [RigExpert][AA-35 Zoom] is invaluable and
well worth the investment. The [GRA-7350T] being the quickest to setup
as I have baselines already for all bands I work and only adjust for the
conditions at the time which are generally minute.

I definitely find the N3FJP [Amateur Contact Log][ACLog] software is my
choice working really well with WSJT-X and GridTracker and being able to
upload my logs to both [QRZ] and [LotW]. I stil find many that only log
to [QRZ] and not [LotW] as I can't submit for credit on some awards if I
only get the QSL on [QRZ]. I also find QRZ reporting differences in the
contact logs, most commonly their county, grid or state and I will only
edit my log if I find it has been confirmed through [LotW] and will only
edit to match the details in that QSL.

I also was able to start the year off with receiving my CQ Magazine
Digital WPX certificate for 300 digital prefixes confirmed along with my
North America continental endorsement for 250 NA prefixes confirmed.

The weekend after New Years I was able to make it out to do another POTA
activation so I could get my POTA New Year 2024 Activator certificate.
With the Park to Park contacts I made while doing so I also managed to also get my POTA New Year 2024 Hunter certificate.

All in all, not a bad way to start the new year and see where I end it!
