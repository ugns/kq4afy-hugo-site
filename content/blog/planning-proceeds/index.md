Steps are proceeding in preparation of our cruise later this summer. Visitor
license applications have been filed and already have one back.

<!--more-->

As I discussed in my [previous]({{< ref "/blog/two-favorite-things" >}}) post, the wife and I will
be taking our next cruise later this summer and I'm looking to finally combine my two favorite
things, cruising and radios. We are booked on the [MSC] Seashore to embark out of Port Canaveral on
a seven night Caribbean Cruise with ports of call in Nassau, Bahamas; Ocho Rios, Jamaica; George Town, Cayman Islands; and Cozumel, Mexico. All but Mexico have reciprocity with amateur radio but
they are not part of [CEPT] or [IARP], so that requires filing for a visitor or temporary amateur
radio license. Just as with the FCC, there is a small fee the agencies in charge of granting the
license charge but it's not a big detriment.

I started the process by taking a deep dive into the [MSC] website and published documents available
carefully looking for anything that would prohibit my bringing my radio equipment with me. Many of
the other cruise lines do mention it either favorably or not, but [MSC] had nothing. So to cover my
bases I started by sending an email addressed to the Master of the Ship and copied it to customer
service, the Director of Customer Service, the Vice President of Contact Center and the President of
[MSC]. After a month where all I got was the bounce back to the incorrect email address for the
Captian and an automated response from customer service stating that mailbox wasn't monitored, so I
began trying to reach out by phone to the other executives I'd included in the email. None of which
answered my call or returned the messages I left.

Feeling I had done all I could do at this point and embarkation day drawing closer, based on the
time frames I'd been given by [OfReg][OFREG] in the Cayman Islands and [URCA] in the Bahamas that
I had already been in contact with I knew I needed to get my applications in to be sure I had the
license back in time for the trip. Of those two, the [OfReg][OFREG] was the most expedient and I
probably could have waited until later to file as I got my license back within a day. I was issued
ZF2JE as my call sign to use while in the Cayman Islands. While I'm only planning to be there for a
day during this trip, the license is good for a year and I do have the option to renew it so I can
use it again in the future when traveling to the Cayman Islands. As this is not our first cruise to
the Cayman Islands I can see using it again as a definite possibility. Not to mention there will be
a bunch more [POTA] parks that I won't be able to get to activate this trip, so I have to go back!

I did get an email back from [URCA] that my application is being processed and I'd previously been
informed it could take 3-4 weeks so I'm patiently awaiting that license still. I have not yet heard
back from my application submission to [SMA] of Jamaica but I intend to follow up on it next week.
From what I've been able to find it seems that I won't be issued a new call sign like in the Cayman
Islands but authorized to operate using the country prefix added to my existing FCC call sign. I
will be able to confirm this once I get official authorization back, so I'll have to add that to a
follow-up post.

I've been in touch with [ZF1PB] from [CARS], who was wonderful in helping with my planning prep and
I'm looking forward to actually getting to meet up with while on the island. I have also reached out
to [JARA] to try and see if I can't make contact with some hams in Jamaica that might want to get
together as well.

When I initially started planning for this I did only have my General class license, but while
volunteering as Security Assistant Chairman for Orlando HamCation I was able to sit and pass my
Amateur Extra class license. With my Extra license I now can fully make use of [CEPT] as not all
countries have implemented the [CEPT] Novice class license which General falls under, sorry to those
with only Technician class as [CEPT] only covers General and above. The [MSC] Seashore, along with
most [MSC] cruise ships, is flagged under Malta which is a country that has implemented [CEPT]
license but not the [CEPT] Novice class. So now I'm technically able to operate from the ship while
in international waters provided I had permission from the Ship's Master. That is however not part
of my plan so I'm not even trying to pursue that avenue. 

The plan is to take my radio equipment with me and go perform [POTA] activations while ashore in port
on the islands I've gotten permission to operate. If successfully I'll be able to add three more [POTA] DXCC entities and at least three more new parks themselves. I have found parks that are not
too far from the cruise terminal that I should be able to get to, set up, activate and get back
aboard during the port of call hours. At least two of the parks appear to be about a 10-20 minute
walk from the terminal, while another will likely mean needing to grab a taxi or other local
transportation.

I plan to take my typical [POTA] kit which includes my hard-shell case that holds my [FT-991A] and [BLF-1220A] along with my laptop bag to carry my [Yoga 11e], [AA-35 Zoom], [GRA-7350T], [GRA-ULT01],
and my coil of coax. This has been field tested during Winter Field Day and several local [POTA]
activations so far and is easily enough to transport. While I'd like to have my additional bag of
tools and supplies I have to consider I have to get it all in and out in one trip. While the saying
"two is one and one is none" with regards to antenna preparedness, I only have the one that is
portable enough for this trip. I would love to take my PREDator antenna but the fiberglass rods to
elevate the radials would definitely be a potential issue getting aboard the cruise ship. Possibly
there may be a trip to the islands while not aboard a cruise to stay for a few days and then I would
bring it along or even have it shipped over ahead of my arrival.

So for now, I've done what I can and the wait is on. After getting my license from [OfReg][OFREG], I
did go and get it setup on [QRZ] and [LotW] with a call sign certificate and setup the station in
TQSL so I'll be ready to upload my logs once I'm back online. My logs will likely not be uploaded
until we're back home as I don't typically get the WiFi aboard the cruise as the point is to actually
disconnect from work and the internet while on vacation. The wife tolerated the wedding trip
including me fixing a server remotely from the hotel business center all those years ago, I'm not
going to press my luck! I will also be trying to take a nice photo from each park location to make
a custom electronic QSL card that I'll email out when logs are uploaded.

Still yet more to come as the trip approaches, so stay tuned.
