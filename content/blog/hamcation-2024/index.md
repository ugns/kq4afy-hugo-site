Orlando [HamCation][HAMCATION] put together by [OARC] is one of the
world's largest hamfests, currently second to Dayton [Hamvention][HAMVENTION] held in May, is fast approaching.

<!--more-->

As the days quickly pass by us we keep getting closer to the start of
Orlando [HamCation][HAMCATION]. Last year was my first year attending
and I enjoyed myself while working double shifts volunteering for the
Security team. I was still able to find time to check out all the
vendors, swap tables and a fair share of the tailgaters. I also made it
to several of the forum sessions as well.

2024 is shaping up to be another great year for HamCation, the only big
difference for me this year is that I stepped up when the call went out
for assistance, and I'll be working this year as a Security Assistant
Chairman. So while everyone is coming to enjoy HamCation Feburary 9th
thru the 11th, I have been partipating in the planning for the months
leading up to now and will be busy entire week prior starting on the
5th of Feburary. For me this is my PTO vacation time from my day job.

Events like HamCation just don't happen. They take an army of volunteers
and people dedicated to making sure everything is taken care of. For me
it is one more way I can be a part of the community I enjoy and surround
myself with plenty of likeminded people.

This year we will be looking forward to many vendors who are attending for
the first time, as well as those who haven't attended since before the
pandemic put the world on pause. We also have international organizations
that will be attending after years spent inviting and cultivating. As always
there will be those vendors and organizations that attend every year and help
make HamCation the event it has grown to be.

So I hope to be able to see and meet as many other hams as I can that
make it out to HamCation this year. I hope to eventually be able to make
it up to Ohio for [Hamvention][HAMVENTION] as I have not yet, but it is
definitely on the radar for me. I'm thankful to be able to have [OARC]
local and with all the activities I can assist and take part in with.
