Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Just sharing my thoughts as Orlando
[HamCation][HAMCATION] 2024 comes to a close.

<!--more-->

Orlando [HamCation][HAMCATION] opened Friday morning after a week of
prep work by the various teams of volunteers helping to put it on. For
me the week was especially long and hard dealing with family health
issues throwing a wrench in the works, but we just have to overcome and
prevail! I personally can not say enough praise and appreciation for the
whole of the [HamCation][HAMCATION] committee members who kept my family
in their thoughts, asked how things were going and made sure I still had
time to get away to take care of things while still maintaing the
commitment I made to assist.

Friday I purchased extra prize tickets to get a chance at some of the
hourly door prize drawings. There were a lot of nice prizes that had
been donated by the various vendors in attendance. I managed to end up
with two hourly prizes by the end of the day. The first was an Explorer
QRZ-1 5W UHF/VHF HT donated by [GigaParts][GIGAPARTS], and the other
was a ticket for Dayton [Hamvention][HAMVENTION] donated by [DARA]!

Now, I do not really have a need for the QRZ-1 radio as I already have
my Yaesu FT-70D and ICOM ID-52A HTs that I operate UHF/VHF with, so I
will most likely be donating this to be gifted to a new Technician that
could make use of it to get on the air. The [Hamvention][HAMVENTION]
ticket though is another story. As I said in my earlier post, going to
[Hamvention][HAMVENTION] is on my TODO list so now I really don't have
an excuse. The XYL doesn't seem to share my enthusiasum in getting the
ticket as I do, so we'll see how things look later this year in May as
we'll have been back home for about a month after our scheduled cruise.

The only downside to my Friday, if I had to call it that, was in barely
missing the mark to pass my Amateur Extra class examination. Myself and
another chairman went to go sit our exam and while he managed to pass, I
found myself falling a little short. This was new for me as I've always
passed any certification  exam I've sat for in my professional career as
well as when I took my Tech and General exams. I'll freely admit this
one presented me with a genuine challenge, which only made me even more
determined to acheive it. I went home Friday night and studied until I
feel asleep, then got up and took another practice exam before starting
the day again opening up [HamCation][HAMCATION].

In between performing security dispatch duties I continued to study up
until lunch. Finally after lunch I made my way over to the testing
session building to take my second attempt at my goal. As I finally sat
back and took a deep breath, I hit the *Grade Exam* button and [W4RSR],
one of the VEs who had been present for my first attempt and wished me
luck before I started my second, walked over to finish processing my
exam. I let out a big sigh of relief as it came back with a passing
score! I had not managed to get a passing score on any of my practice
attempts, but when it came down to one that mattered I managed to make
it happen. With my Tech I had solidly consistent passing pratice exams,
and with my General I was at least 50-50.

The remainder of Saturday went by in a blur as I was ecstatic about
meeting my goal for the weekend and leaving as an Extra class amateur
radio operator. I had started to study earlier last year, but had only
picked up the pace after New Years as [HamCation][HAMCATION] approached.
My thanks go out to the entire VE team that volunteers to administer the
exams during the weekend and before regular monthly [OARC] meetings.

I did run into some of the guys from [SRC] going around the commercial
vendor hall on both Friday & Saturday along with some of my other fellow
operators that I've enjoyed doing [POTA] activations with.

Sunday was a short day and brought a close to a great weekend. The
weather couldn't have been any better. I made my rounds through the
commercial vendors hall and swaps getting one last chance to hang out
and talk with some of the great groups that came out for the weekend. I
made sure I stopped by the [DARC] and [RSGB] booths as this was both
groups first years attending. As always it was a pleasure to see [ECR]
at [HamCation][HAMCATION], though this year instead of out in the forums
they had a booth in the Swaps hall. Wonderful conversations all weekend
long with Jill & Scott of [Tower Electronics][TOWER]. I spent quite a
bit of time with Rick, Donna and Finley from [The SignMan of Baton Rouge][SIGNMAN].

All in all, it was a great [HamCation][HAMCATION] this year! Now I'm
going to try and recover before having to return to my regular work week
schedule, but I'll already be planning and saving the dates for next
year! Hope to see you then, until then 73.
