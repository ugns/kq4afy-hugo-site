Cruise embarkation day is fast approaching! So let us talk about the plan, assuming no issues are encountered with [MSC Cruises][MSC].

<!--more-->

## The cruise itself

So we will be embarking aboard the MSC Seashore on April 7th and returning on the 14th. This will be our second [MSC] cruise since we began cruising back in 2018 and the first time I will be attempting to cruise with my radio equipment. At this point, I have made every effort to reach out to [MSC] and secure written approval to bring my radio onboard the ship. As I've said in my previous posts on this series, I am not looking to operate while at sea and instead looking to only operate [POTA] while we are at our ports of call along the route. I began reaching out via email back in January, progressing to phone call atempts in February, and finally received a single call from a [MSC] representative in early March that had no further follow-up. I have spoken with some YouTube content creators who have dealt with [MSC] while bringing their drone aboard to use while at port, which were favorable so I have every hope that the same will be the case for me.

I have copies of all documentation in the case holding my actual radio and another copy in my laptop bag that I will have with me. This documentation includes my FCC license (KQ4AFY), my Cayman Islands license (ZF2JE) from [OfReg][OFREG] and my Bahamas license (KQ4AFY/C6A) from [URCA] along with a copy of the FCC Public Notice DA 16-1048 that is required under [CEPT]. This along with my US passport should be all I need to be legal to operate from the ship, Cayman Islands and the Bahamas.

## Nassau, Bahamas

Our itinerary has us scheduled to be into port in Nassau by 10:00 on Monday, April 8th. I am estimating about an hour to get off the ship and make it to [BS-0025] and get ready to activate. I have already signed up with the [Bahamas National Trust][BNT] for an annual membership to support their efforts in maintaining the parks and it also provides free entry to all parks as well. If I had not purchased the membership the park does have a $12 fee to enter according to the website. The membership is good for a year and good at all Bahamas parks so I am looking at it as I did purchasing my Florida State Parks annual family pass. We are scheduled to depart by 18:00 so I will look to be completed and back to the terminal by around 17:00.

Initially I had thought about trying to also activate [BS-0023] and [BS-0022], but I have found out recently that [BS-0023] is currently closed and I am unsure about transportation necessary to reach [BS-0022] and return in time. None of these parks have been activated yet so I was looking forward to the first activator.

## George Town, Cayman Islands

![KY-0010: George Town, Cayman Islands](/images/POTA-CaymanIslands.png)

We are scheduled to arrive in George Town by 08:00 on Thursday, April 11th. George Town is a tender port, which means that we will not dock at the port terminal and have to take a smaller boat to the terminal. Again, I am expecting at least an hour to get ashore as past experience has proven that tender passage can be organized chaos. Luckily for me [KY-0010] is within a short walking distance from the port terminal. We have a scheduled departure of 16:00, so I will give myself at least an hour to get back to the terminal and catch a tender back aboard the ship.

I have been in touch with [ZF1PB] who is involved with [CARS], so I will be trying to make contact with him while I'm ashore. He has informed me of the local repeater so I will try to reach out using my HT when I get within range. Perhaps if he has transportation I will be able to get to a few of the other nearby parks like [KY-0003], [KY-0009] or [KY-0004] which are not too far from port. Maybe even [KY-0001] which is not far from the [CARS] club ham shack, which I have heard has a pretty extensive antenna array.

## The Band Plan

I have listed preliminary activation schedules on the [POTA] website already. Given the time of day I will be on the island I believe it will be highly unlikely that I will do any work on 40-80m. So I am planning to target 10-20m depending on propagation on the bands when I arrive and get set up to operate. I will begin with working digital over FT8 or FT4 in an attempt to secure the QSOs necessary for a successful activation as quickly as possible. If I have time I will attempt to switch my setup to SSB and find a frequency free to work.

While my cell phone has data service on the islands, I am uncertain if I will have it while at the parks themselves. To account for this and be able to spot myself I have gotten everything configured to use [SOTAmat] which I can send out over FT8 and let the skimmers spot me.

I will attempt to check my Winlink mailbox while I'm at the parks and if I have cell phone data service I will have my Hamshack Hotline extension and my OpenSpot 4 PRO hotspot connected to the D-STAR reflector.

I am also beta testing [PoLo][POLO] as a portable logbook using my mobile phone. While operating SSB I may simply utilize this to log rather than reconfigure my laptop from WSJT-X handling rig control to Amateur Contact Log handling it on the fly. I will then just simply export the ADIF log from [PoLo][POLO] and import it into AC Log before I upload my logs to [POTA], [LoTW] and [QRZ]. I have already registered my callsigns with all three and have my [LoTW] callsign certificates issued.

## 73

If everything goes as planned, upon my return home I will get all my logs finalized and uploaded. I will be trying to get some good photos of my activation set up at each park so that I can put together a custom digital QSL card that I will then send out to all my QSOs if they have an email address available on [QRZ]. I will also put together a final post on this series with my takeaways and advice based on how it all worked, or didn't. I hope to have this only be the first cruise trip I am able to take with my radio. While the XYL doesn't want it to be all future cruises, I do hope to be able to take it along and get the chance to activate parks that I will only be able to operate within while traveling.

73, and I'll catch you down in the log!
