Osceola County is a Storm Ready County and will be having their 2023
Before the Storm hurricane preparation event this month.

<!--more-->

With the 2023 hurricane season approaching it is time to make sure
that you have your hurricane preparations in order. This years free
event is taking place on Saturday, May 20th at the Kissimmee Civic
Center from 10 AM to 1 PM. Osceola County ARES/EMCAT will be having
volunteers on hand as will other groups and organizations to provide
information.

I am planning to be in attendance and working with the Osceola County
ARES/EMCAT group during the event.
