Dayton [Hamvention][HAMVENTION] is coming up May 17-18th and I will be attending this year after having gotten my ticket during Orlando [HamCation][HAMCATION].

<!--more-->

Since getting my license in 2022 I have not made the trip to Dayton for [Hamvention][HAMVENTION], but it has been on my TODO list. While working [HamCation][HAMCATION] back in February I had purchased additional hourly prize tickets and was surprised by winning my ticket for this years event.

I will be heading out on my road trip sometime Thursday the 16th and arriving in Dayton on Friday. I don't have any concrete plans for the trip itself by do plan to bring my radio gear along so I may stop for some [POTA] activations along the way if I can identify some parks not too far off my path.

While at [Hamvention][HAMVENTION] I will be hanging out and helping with the Orlando [HamCation][HAMCATION] booth along with some of the other committee chairmen who are planning on driving up separately as well.
