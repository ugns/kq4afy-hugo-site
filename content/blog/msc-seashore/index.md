It's Cruise Day! So let's get aboard [MSC Cruises][MSC] Seashore and talk about how Operation [POTA] Cruise went after all the preparations.

<!--more-->

## First impressions

So embarkation aboard [MSC] Seashore went relatively straightforward and without event. Security did take a pause when my Apache 4800 case from Harbor Freight that held my Yaesu [FT-991A] and Bioenno Power [BLF-1220A] LiFePO4 battery went through the x-ray machine, but that was quickly resolved when the operator called his supervisor over and she just had me open up the case and show her what was inside. There were no questions asked when I simply stated that it was my radio and battery. I was wearing one of my [OARC] button down shirts with my ARES pin on it along with my Yaesu ball cap from [Orlando HamCation][HAMCATION] that I had embroderied with my callsign, so as a fellow ham stated, I was really running in "stealth mode"! This was the moment that I was expecting if I were to have any issues it would happen here. After we got through security we quickly went through the check-in process and were onboard the ship picking our keys up at our stateroom door.

We explored the ship a bit and were surprised when our baggage was delivered to our stateroom only a couple hours after we had boarded. The mandatory muster drill process had changed since our last cruises back in 2021-2022 after the restart, but we had it over quickly and were back to our stateroom to get unpacked before we went down to the main dining room for dinner. Dinner was decent but nothing really to write home about, a common complaint among cruisers from other cruise lines as well so nothing unexpected. We were pretty worn out as usual getting to the ship and starting the cruise so we decided to call it an early night and go back to the cabin after watching the SpaceX rocket launch from the aft Infinity Pool area on deck 8 with some other guests.

## First day take aways

So far, we are not impressed with the ship itself or the staff (except our lovely room steward). We had asked several crew members questions and got multiple conflicting answers, which shows that all information is not consistently made available to customer-facing crew. I can't really say I'm surprised by this given the abyssmal response I got just simply attempting to confirm I would not have any issue bringing my radio aboard for the cruise. Our accessible ocean view staterooom had several issues, some were easily resolvable and some not. Our room safe was non-operational when we boarded and required having it reset to get it back to operating state. Our wardrobe doors were misaligned and have to be manhandled to open and close them. My mother-in-law's balcony door appears to be warped making it difficult to open and close it smoothly. Aside from the crystal staircase in the midship atrium, the decor is very bland. For this being [MSC]'s newest ship, the issues and lack luster seems like serious failing. Still, we're at sea on a cruise and I'm going to be operating [POTA], so can't really complain about that and the price for the cruise was right. That is one area [MSC] has made up as their cruise rates are really competitive against the other established cruise lines in the US market.

## First POTA Operation

We woke up Monday morning in Nassau, Bahamas ready to get off the ship. We started the morning having breakfast in the buffet before I left my wife and mother-in-law to go back to the stateroom to grab my equipment and head off the ship. As I was getting my sail card scanned to disembark the ship I had the security officer question the Apache 4800 case and what was inside. It had apparently been too easy during embarkation it would seem. He made a call and Handro the deputy security officer soon came to speak with me. I showed him all of my [license]({{< relref "gallery/license" >}}) documents and he took some photos of them and my radio before letting me go ashore.

I made my way down the new Nassau cruise terminal and made it to the taxi stand and was quickly on my way to The Retreat Garden ([BS-0025]). I got the taxi drivers number so I could text him when I was done so he could get me back to the cruise port. I checked in with the office, showing them Bahamas National Trust ([BNT]) membership card and that I was going to be operating amateur radio doing a POTA activation. I walked along the trails enjoying the beautiful scenery. I found a nice open clearing and while I was preparing to unpack and setup my station had one of the park employees come by to check and see if I needed anything. He showed me a clearing just a little bit further that had a nice wooden bench to sit at that would work even better so grabbed my stuff and moved over to it. I also explained POTA to him and provided him with the tri-fold brochure I had printed out from the POTA website.

I had the Gabil Radio [GRA-7350T] antenna setup and had checked with my RigExpert [AA-35 Zoom] antenna analyzer for 20m and had a nice 1.3:1 SWR, which is even better than I typically had when operating from home. In about 30 minutes I had made four contacts and seemed to not hear anything back to my calls. I stopped and threw the AA-35 back on the line and found the SWR was over 10, tried to drop it down to 15m and still the SWR was way too high to operate on. I finally dropped it down to 10m and found the SWR was still a bit high, at 2.3:1, but workable so I returned to trying to make contacts. I found 8 contacts within the next 10 minutes and had enough for a valid activation. I made another contact five minutes later and then my laptop crashed and I took that as a sign that I was done for the day and began packing up to head back to the ship. I texted my taxi driver and he showed up quickly and had me back to the cruise terminal in no time.

## Handling the hurdle

As I was boarding the ship and security scanned my sail card it popped up with an alert so he once again called and Handro was returning to speak with me. While we waited me and the security officer were talking about amateur radio, [POTA] and what was required to operate. Handro arrived and explained that he'd spoken with the staff captain while I was out and that he (staff captain) wanted to have the ship's electronics officer to examine my radio to ensure it would not interfere with ships communications, which I found were operating within the 467 MHz frequency. The electronic's officer asked me a few questions about the antenna I was using and told Handro that he didn't see any concern of interference. When Handro called the staff captain to let him know what the electronics officer had said and just asked that we keep the radio in secure storage and that I just request it from reception when I was going to go off ship and they'd bring it to the gangway for me to exit with it. I was able to take my LiFePO4 battery out of the case so that I could take it back to my stateroom and recharge it to be ready for Thursday when we arrive in George Town, Cayman Islands.

The entire experience was very courteous and professional. My wife had made me promise before the cruise that I wouldn't cause a scene if I had any issues with the ship and my radio, but there was really no cause for that concern. Handro had stated that all my paperwork was in order and legal, but that it was just an uncommon event that they didn't know how to handle it. He even said that with all my paperwork and realizing that I was legal under [CEPT] to operate onboard under the Malta flag the ship sailed under that there would have been no issue running the request up the chain of command to get approval from the ship's captain, but I had reiterated that I wasn't attempting to do so as I did not have a balcony room and that was not the intent of my cruise. I did inquire about the proper contact points I could have made prior to the cruise and explained that I had started trying to reach out to [MSC] Cruises starting in January and had not received any follow-up on those attempts. He acknowledged and apologized for the lack of communcation. Again, the entire process was very low stress and Handro even asked that I get him my contact information so he could inquire more about it all when he had time.

## Ham radio operators everywhere

After dinner I got the wife back to our stateroom and then went to take our water bottles up to the buffet on deck 16 to refill them with water before I took my laptop to find a place to sit and prepare my logs and record my notes on the day. While waiting at the elevator, I had a gentleman walk up and introduce himself as [W0WD] as he shook my hand. I had been wearing my [OARC] shirt with my name and callsign on it, again I am crusing in "stealth mode" after all! I immediately recognized the callsign as net control from the [LISATS] repeater, K4GCC, that covers the space launches. We've spoken over the air on several past occasions when I've been over to the Space Coast to watch a launch, but this was the first time we had met in person. We spent the elevator ride up talking about radio and I had mentioned I'd brought mine aboard and operated [POTA] today while we were in port. He said when I don't hear him running net control for the launches it was because he was here on a cruise ship.
